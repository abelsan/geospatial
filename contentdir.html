                        <p>Sergio Herrero is currently a Ph.D. candidate at MIT. At the MIT IESL Lab, he was worked on the integration of massively threaded multiprocessor arrays in Hadoop and the modification of its pipeline, in order to minimize latency and allow the execution of stream learning algorithms. At Microsoft Research, he constructed a Network Diagnostics Service for Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio capable of troubleshooting connectivity and security problems within the Decentralized Software Services (DSSP 1.0) network graph of a distributed robotics application; in addition, he focused on Real-Time Visualizations of the status of connectivity graphs using Silverlight 2.0. At the MIT Auto-ID Lab, he constructed a Distributed In-Memory Database for the RFID Network. This project consisted of the design of a scalable and flexible architecture capable of accommodating and handling the information flow generated by thousands of millions of RFID tags as they move through the supply chain.</p>

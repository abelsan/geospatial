Targeted at future CTOs who must understand both the business and technical issues involved in architecting enterprise-scale systems. Student teams confront technically challenging problems. Lectures and readings cover core database, XML, web server components and browser issues in a distributed web service environment.ESD.341J Architecting and Engineering Software Systems will place particular emphasis on properly architecting enterprise systems, such as for large-scale public service projects (e.g. HAP Visualization Project). ESD.341J will also take a close look at enterprise software systems, which depend upon properly architected (for scalability, security, and speed), provenance-aware, robust geospatial platform undergirdings.",
